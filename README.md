#STA 141B Final Project
####-- Data crawling and mutiple gene alignment visturalization By Python
#### Group ?? 
## Introduction

Gene alignment is the process of comparing the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of two or more genes to identify similarities and differences between them .Gene alignment can be used to identify evolutionary relationships between different organisms or to analyze the genetic variation within a single organism.And it use full tool for the Evolution and Ecology Biology.

In this project we are trying to craw data from the NCBI data base for mutiple gene alignment between Wheat: (T. aestivum) , Hordeum (Hordeum vulgare.L) Rye(Secale cereale L.) and other plant species. The purpose of multiple gene alignment is to identify conserved regions across multiple genes, which can provide insight into the functional importance of certain sequences 

We are aiming at do a frequences test of genes between each organisms and visturlized the gene frequence and visturlize them by building up a phylogenetic trees by Python packages. We are also inerested in using machine learning and cluster method to draw a conclusion from the data.

The main focus of this Project will be data crawling and visturalization of the data, we are not going to discuss the fundimental biological mechanism behind the packages and data.
